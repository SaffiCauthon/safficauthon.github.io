After six years of abuse <a href="https://fujitsuscannerstore.com/cg01000-307401/">I got a new keyboard</a>!

I told myself in 2017 that my HHKB Pro 2 was my "end game" and I would never buy another keyboard again.

Yet here I am in 2023 with the HHKB HYBRID Type-S (Snow). Hopefully I get another 6 years of abuse out of this one!
