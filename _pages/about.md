**Hi, I'm Saffi Cauthon!**

Hopefully, you've found this collection of webpages in goodwill. This website is for Runescape & Old School Runescape purposes.

I am an avid RuneScape veteran who has played the game for 15+ years.

I enjoy playing with an efficient mindset and learning about various game mechanics. You will often find me contributing to niche community projects and helping document anything I can get my hands on.

Previously I helped administrate, develop, and  support projects such as <a href="https://templeosrs.com/">TempleOSRS.com</a> and <a href="https://discord.com/invite/FXPUrUp">The Volcanic Mine Discord Server</a>.

I am part of several groups, such as <a href="https://twitter.com/Totus">Totus</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Omnia_Clan">Omnia</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/The__Summit">The Summit</a>.
